    <h1>LIAR'S DECK - GAME RULES</h1>
    <p class="tagline">A deadly game of deception where your poker face is the only thing standing between you and the trigger.</p>

    <h2>The Deck</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 Aces</li>
      <li>6 Kings</li>
      <li>6 Queens</li>
      <li>2 Jokers (wild cards)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Each player is dealt 5 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Players take turns clockwise.</li>
      <li>On your turn, you must play 1-3 cards face down and declare what they are (e.g., "Two Aces").</li>
      <li>You can lie about the cards you're playing.</li>
      <li>The next player has two choices:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Play Selected:</strong> Take the cards without looking and play their turn.</li>
          <li><strong>Call Liar:</strong> Call the previous player’s bluff.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a player challenges, the cards are revealed:
        <ul>
          <li>If the challenger is correct (the player lied), the liar must face the revolver.</li>
          <li>If the challenger is wrong (the player told the truth), the challenger must face the revolver.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Revolver Phase</h2>
    <p>The revolver has 6 chambers, only one is loaded. Spin and pull the trigger:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you survive, you stay in the game.</li>
      <li>If you get shot, you're out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p>The last player standing wins the game.</p>
